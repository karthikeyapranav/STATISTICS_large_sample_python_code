# STATISTICS_large_sample_python_code
by using this program we can calculate single mean of large sample data and it'll tell weather it reject or accept hypothesis
Code Explanation
The code begins by importing the necessary modules, math and statistics, for mathematical calculations and statistical functions, respectively.

It prompts the user to enter the value of mu_null, which represents the null hypothesis mean.

The user is then prompted to enter the sample size (n), which indicates the number of observations in the sample.

The variable table is assigned the value 1.96, which corresponds to the critical value for a 95% confidence interval (commonly used in hypothesis testing).

The code prompts the user to input the observed values (x). The input is split using whitespace as the delimiter and stored in a list (myarr). The observed values are then converted from strings to floating-point numbers.

The calculated x_bar (sample mean) is obtained by summing all the values in myarr and dividing by the length of myarr.

The code checks if the length of x is less than 5. If true, it prompts the user to enter the standard deviation (s) for further calculations. Otherwise, it calculates the standard deviation using the statistics.stdev() function on myarr.

The calculated value of s is then printed.

Based on the length of x, the code performs different calculations. If the length is less than j (501), it calculates the z-score (z3) using the formula: (x_bar - mu_null) / (s / math.sqrt(n)).

If the length is greater than j, it calculates the z-score (z4) and adds it as a single-element tuple.

The calculated z-score is printed.

The code performs a hypothesis test by comparing the calculated z-score with the critical value stored in table. If the calculated z-score is less than table, it prints "accept null hypothesis." Otherwise, it prints "reject null hypothesis."

Usage
To use this code, follow these steps:

Copy the code and save it in a Python file with a ".py" extension (e.g., hypothesis_test.py).

Ensure that you have Python installed on your system.

Run the Python file using a Python interpreter or an integrated development environment (IDE) that supports Python.

When prompted, enter the required input values:

mu_null: The value of the null hypothesis mean.
n: The sample size (number of observations).
x: The observed values separated by whitespace.
If the length of x is less than 5, you will be prompted to enter the standard deviation (s).
The code will calculate the z-score and perform the hypothesis test, printing the results.

Note: It's important to ensure that the input values are appropriate for your specific hypothesis test and data. The code assumes a one-sample z-test for testing a null hypothesis about the population mean. Make sure to adjust the code accordingly if you are performing a different type of hypothesis test or have different requirements.
